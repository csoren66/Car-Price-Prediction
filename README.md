Predicting the price of used cars.
Being able to estimate the market value of used cars can benefit both buyers and sellers.
Many people have been interested in the used automobile market at some point in their lives because they wanted to sell or acquire a used vehicle. It's a great mistake to pay too much or sell for less than the market worth in this process.


We will use several features such as Present Price, Selling Price, Kms Driven, Fuel Type, Year, and others to anticipate the price of used cars in this project. Kaggle was utilised to obtain the data for this project.
